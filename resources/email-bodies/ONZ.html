<body>
  <p>Excellencies,</p>

  <p>
    We have the honour to draw your esteemed attention to the recent statements
    and threats made by the Israeli Minister, Mr. Ben Gvir, against the Global
    Sumud Flotilla, a civilian initiative composed of vessels carrying
    exclusively humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza Strip.
  </p>

  <p>
    This initiative is strictly humanitarian in nature and fully consistent with
    international law, in particular:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The Charter of the United Nations (Articles 55 and 56), which calls for
      international cooperation in humanitarian relief and the protection of
      fundamental rights;
    </li>
    <li>
      The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982, Articles 87 and
      90), which guarantees freedom of navigation on the high seas;
    </li>
    <li>
      Resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, which
      reaffirm the duty to protect humanitarian missions.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Threats to employ force against civilian vessels on the high seas
    constitute:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      A grave violation of the freedom of navigation, guaranteed under customary
      international law and UNCLOS;
    </li>
    <li>
      A form of intimidation and unlawful state violence, contrary to Article
      2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which prohibits the threat or
      use of force;
    </li>
    <li>
      A direct obstruction to the obligations of States to ensure humanitarian
      access to civilians in distress, as provided under the Geneva Conventions
      and Additional Protocol I (Article 70).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In light of these threats, we respectfully call upon all Member States of
    the United Nations to:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Publicly condemn any threat or use of force against the Global Sumud
      Flotilla and its civilian participants;
    </li>
    <li>
      Safeguard the freedom of navigation on the high seas, in accordance with
      international law;
    </li>
    <li>
      Reaffirm the inviolability of humanitarian action, which must be protected
      under all circumstances;
    </li>
    <li>
      Support the deployment of international observers to guarantee the safety
      of humanitarian flotillas bound for Gaza.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    We urge you to act with urgency and unity to ensure that the unlawful
    threats made by Israeli officials are brought to an end, and that the
    unhindered passage of humanitarian aid to Gaza is effectively guaranteed.
    The credibility of the multilateral system and the primacy of international
    law depend upon your vigilance and decisive action.
  </p>

  <p>
    I trust in your commitment to human rights and humbly appeal for your
    support in ensuring the protection of Global Sumud Flotilla.
    <br />
    [NAME]
